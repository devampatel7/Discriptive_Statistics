# Discriptive_Statistics


## Discription 

This is a simple program that displays discriptive statics such as mean and standard deviation from a given dataset. The data is obtained by rolling 3 fair dice 1000 times and summing them up. In this program, several methods are used to calculate the minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and displaying a histogram based on the number of occurences of a specific sum (ranging from 3-18).

## Sample Output  
min: 3  
max: 18  
standard deviation: 2.8284271247461903

## How to improve 

Make this program more generic and accessible to different datasets. Find the minimum and maximum more efficiently by using binary search or other efficient methods. Add more statistical aspects such as median, mode, and even graphs.
